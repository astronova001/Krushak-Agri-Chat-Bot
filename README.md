## Overview

Farmers often struggle to find the information they need because it is scattered across many websites and platforms. Many farmers are not even aware of government portals where they can get details about subsidies, loans, or farming equipment. Even when they know about these portals, the information is not well-organized in one place.

**Krushak-Agri-Chat-Bot** solves this problem by acting as a one-stop solution for all agriculture-related queries. It provides all the information farmers need and allows them to find answers quickly. To make things even easier, Krushak-Agri-Chat-Bot is deployed on WhatsApp, a platform many farmers are familiar with. This eliminates the need for browsing the internet, making data more accessible to those who prefer WhatsApp.
